# Ubidots Python API Client Test

Python script to test the download of ubidots data for streamlined data
analysis.

File 1, "ubidots_python_api_test", uses the Ubidots API Client module.

File 2, "ubidots_python_api_test_HTTP" uses HTTP protocols.

During this test, I found it much easier to access data via HTTP protocols, but
I'll leave both here for reference.
